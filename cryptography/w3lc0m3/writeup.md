This one is very easy, you just need to figure out what the scrambled flag is

This is pretty obvious, "Your flag"

```
EpnX{5JU7H_T33_B6N1N1}N6
```
I know the flag prefix is EnXp, now just need to figure out the rest.
I tried to see the last two word, it looks very much like "THE BEGINNING", and I think the first word is "JUST"  so I rearrange it like this
```
EpnX{JU57_TH3_B361NN1N6}
```
yay
